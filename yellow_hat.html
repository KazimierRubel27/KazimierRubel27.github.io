        Theodore "Ted" Shackleford (known to the public in Curious George as The Man with the Yellow Hat)
        is one of the main characters of the Curious George franchise. He is first voiced by Will Ferrell in the 2006 animated film
        and then later Jeff Bennett in the TV series and sequels. 
        In Curious George (2006), Ted gets his trademark yellow suit when he's tricked by the shop owners into purchasing it.
        He then meets George, a playful but curious monkey who changes his life forever.
